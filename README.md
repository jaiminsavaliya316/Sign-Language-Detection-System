# Sign Language Detection System 🤟

Real-time hand sign recognition through webcam using machine learning and computer vision.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Speech-impaired individuals communicate through hand signs and gestures, creating a communication barrier with those unfamiliar with sign language. This project bridges that gap by automatically detecting and interpreting hand signs in real-time.

## 💡 Solution

A machine learning-based detection system that:
- 📹 Captures hand signs through webcam in real-time
- 🤖 Recognizes and classifies different gestures using Machine Learning
- 🌉 Bridges communication between speech-impaired and hearing individuals
- ⚡ Provides instant recognition and interpretation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TensorFlow** - Deep learning framework
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision and video processing
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **TensorFlow Object Detection API** - Pre-trained model integration
- **SSD MobileNet** - Lightweight object detection model

## 🚀 Why Transfer Learning?

Training convolutional networks from scratch is time-consuming and requires massive datasets. This project leverages **transfer learning** using TensorFlow's pre-trained models:

✅ **Faster development**
✅ **Better accuracy**
✅ **Resource efficient**

### Pre-trained Model: SSD MobileNet
- Optimized for real-time detection on standard hardware
- Balances speed and accuracy for webcam applications
- Available through [TensorFlow Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)
